# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the IRR Genius app by adding comprehensive data management capabilities including persistent storage of calculations, improved user interface elements, and the ability to import calculation data from external sources. These improvements will allow users to save their work, access historical calculations, and efficiently import data from spreadsheets and CSV files, making the app more practical for professional use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a financial professional, I want to save my IRR calculations so that I can review and reference them later without having to re-enter all the data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes an IRR calculation THEN the system SHALL automatically save the calculation with a timestamp
2. WHEN a user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a list of previously saved calculations
3. WHEN a user selects a saved calculation THEN the system SHALL load all input parameters and results
4. WHEN a user wants to delete a saved calculation THEN the system SHALL provide a delete option with confirmation
5. IF the device storage is full THEN the system SHALL notify the user and prevent new saves

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved interface that makes it easier to navigate between different calculation modes and manage my saved data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display a clear navigation structure with tabs or menu options
2. WHEN a user switches between calculation modes THEN the system SHALL preserve unsaved input data with a warning
3. WHEN a user accesses saved calculations THEN the system SHALL display them in an organized list with calculation type, date, and key metrics
4. WHEN a user performs calculations THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for loading states and errors
5. IF a calculation takes longer than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to import calculation data from spreadsheets and CSV files so that I can quickly analyze existing datasets without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects import option THEN the system SHALL support both .xlsx, .xls, and .csv file formats
2. WHEN a user imports a file THEN the system SHALL validate the data format and show preview before import
3. WHEN importing spreadsheet data THEN the system SHALL map columns to appropriate calculation fields (initial investment, cash flows, dates, etc.)
4. WHEN importing CSV data THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify delimiter and header row options
5. IF imported data contains errors THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic entries and allow correction
6. WHEN import is successful THEN the system SHALL populate the calculation form with imported data
7. IF file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL display clear error message with supported formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my calculations and results so that I can share them with colleagues or use them in other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a calculation THEN the system SHALL provide export options for PDF and CSV formats
2. WHEN exporting to PDF THEN the system SHALL include all input parameters, results, and charts in a professional format
3. WHEN exporting to CSV THEN the system SHALL include structured data that can be imported back into the app
4. WHEN a user exports data THEN the system SHALL use the device's native sharing capabilities
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and retry option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my data to be synchronized across devices so that I can access my calculations from multiple devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables cloud sync THEN the system SHALL securely backup calculations to cloud storage
2. WHEN a user logs in on a new device THEN the system SHALL restore previously saved calculations
3. WHEN calculations are modified THEN the system SHALL sync changes across all connected devices
4. IF sync fails THEN the system SHALL store changes locally and retry when connection is restored
5. WHEN user disables sync THEN the system SHALL maintain local data and stop cloud synchronization

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to organize my calculations into projects or categories so that I can better manage multiple investment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user saves a calculation THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to a project or category
2. WHEN a user creates a new project THEN the system SHALL allow custom naming and description
3. WHEN viewing saved calculations THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by project or category
4. WHEN a user deletes a project THEN the system SHALL ask whether to delete contained calculations or move them to default category
5. IF a project contains calculations THEN the system SHALL display the count and most recent activity date
