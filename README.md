# IRR Genius üìä

A comprehensive Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculator built with SwiftUI for iOS and macOS. Calculate IRR, future values, required initial investments, and blended IRR with follow-on investments using a beautiful, intuitive interface.

## ‚ú® Features

### üßÆ Four Calculation Modes

1. **Calculate IRR** - Find the internal rate of return given initial investment, outcome amount, and time period
2. **Calculate Outcome** - Determine future value based on initial investment, IRR, and time period
3. **Calculate Initial Investment** - Find required initial investment to reach a target outcome with given IRR and time
4. **Calculate Blended IRR** - Calculate overall IRR considering multiple follow-on investments over time

### üé® User Experience

- **Real-time comma formatting** for easy number reading (e.g., 1,000,000)
- **Smart input validation** with helpful error messages
- **Month-based time periods** with automatic years conversion display
- **Professional UI** with gradient buttons and smooth animations
- **Cross-platform** support for iOS and macOS
- **Interactive growth charts** with draggable markers to inspect values
- **Dark mode support** with adaptive colors and backgrounds

### üì± Key Features

- **Input Formatting**: Automatic comma insertion for currency fields
- **Time Conversion**: Enter months, see years equivalent in real-time
- **Result Display**: Formatted results with all input values for reference
- **Error Handling**: Clear validation and error messages
- **Loading States**: Professional loading indicators during calculations
- **Follow-on Investments**: Add multiple investments with dates and valuations
- **Investment Types**: Support for Buy, Sell, and Buy/Sell operations

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Calculate IRR

- **Initial Investment**: $10,000
- **Outcome Amount**: $15,000
- **Time Period**: 60 months (5 years)
- **Result**: 8.45% IRR

### Calculate Future Value

- **Initial Investment**: $10,000
- **IRR**: 8.5%
- **Time Period**: 60 months (5 years)
- **Result**: $15,000.00

### Calculate Required Initial Investment

- **Target Outcome**: $15,000
- **IRR**: 8.5%
- **Time Period**: 60 months (5 years)
- **Result**: $10,000.00

### Calculate Blended IRR

#### Tag-Along Investment Example
- **Initial Investment**: $1,000,000
- **Follow-on Investment 1**: $500,000 at month 6 (Tag-Along - follows initial IRR)
- **Follow-on Investment 2**: $500,000 at month 10 (Tag-Along - follows initial IRR)
- **Final Valuation**: $8,000,000
- **Time Period**: 12 months (1 year)
- **Result**: 700% Blended IRR

#### Custom Valuation Example
- **Initial Investment**: $10,000
- **Follow-on Investment 1**: $5,000 at month 12 (computed at 10% IRR)
- **Follow-on Investment 2**: $3,000 at month 24 (specified valuation: $4,500)
- **Final Valuation**: $25,000
- **Time Period**: 60 months (5 years)
- **Result**: 12.34% Blended IRR

## üßÆ Mathematical Formulas

### IRR Calculation

```text
IRR = (Outcome/Initial)^(1/Years) - 1
```

### Future Value Calculation

```text
Future Value = Initial √ó (1 + IRR)^Years
```

### Initial Investment Calculation

```text
Initial = Outcome / (1 + IRR)^Years
```

### Blended IRR Calculation

#### Tag-Along Investments
```text
For tag-along investments, follow-on investments follow the same IRR trajectory as the initial investment:

Investment Growth = Amount √ó (1 + Blended IRR)^(Months Since Investment / 12)

Total Value = Initial Investment Growth + Œ£(Tag-Along Investment Growth)
```

#### Custom Valuations
```text
Blended IRR = (Final Value / Total Time-Weighted Investment)^(1/Total Years) - 1

Where:
Total Time-Weighted Investment = Initial √ó Total Years + Œ£(Investment √ó Years Remaining)
```

#### Investment Types
- **Buy**: Adds to invested capital and final value
- **Sell**: Reduces final value (no capital addition)
- **Buy/Sell**: Adds to invested capital but reduces final value by sell amount
